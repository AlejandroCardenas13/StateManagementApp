# **StateManagementApp** ⚡ ⚡


## Introduction 🔬
It's a simple app where I try somes patterns and ways to have better handling of state management:

- StatefulWidgets and Callback 🚴🏼‍
- BloC and Notifier ✈️
- BloC and Streams 🚀

## Pre requirements 👀 
- Visual Studio Code 1.50.0 v onwards or Android Studio 4.0v onwards
- Flutter SDK 2.0.2v onwards
- Setting Android and Flutter environment variables

## Installation 📡📡
- To clone the repository locally, you must run the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/AlejandroCardenas13/StateManagementApp.git``` 
- Import the project into Visual Studio Code or Android Studio

## Project structure ⚠️
``` 
+ Exceptions ☢️
    Classes that catch exceptions and throw custom messages when the flow with a widget or interaction fails because what was expected is not found.

+ Implemetations 🏇🏻
    Classes where the ways to have a better management of states are going to be implemented.

+ Pages 👾
    Classes where the Widgets to be displayed in the app will be located and the user will have a direct interaction with them.

+ Models 👩
    Classes where attributes of business-relevant objects are abstracted.

```
